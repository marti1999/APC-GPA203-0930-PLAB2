The aim of this proram is to tell whether it is going to rain tomorrow or not. The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package). 


The program consists of:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Preprocessing (normalitzation, outliers, feature selection, ...)
- Machine Learning Models and Techniques (Logistic Regressor, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, KNN, Ensambles)
- Hyperparameter Search (Grid Search and Bayesian Search)
- Cross Validation and Metric Analysis (Precission-Recall and ROC curve)  

Most of the program uses the ML Python library [Scikit-Lern](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
